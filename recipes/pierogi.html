    <h2>Pierogi (Polish Dumplings)</h2>
    <p>This pierogi recipe for Polish dumplings has been a family favorite from generation to generation. We
        traditionally make these for Christmas, but they can be made for any special event. There's some work involved,
        but the outcome is rewarding! The boiled pierogies can be fried in butter and onions or served with sour cream.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>Dough</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (8 ounce) container sour cream</li>
        <li>3 large eggs</li>
        <li>3 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon baking powder</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Sauerkraut Filling</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>⅓ cup chopped onion</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups sauerkraut, drained and minced</li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
        <li>Make sauerkraut filling: Melt butter in a skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir onion in hot butter until
            translucent, about 5 minutes. Add sauerkraut and cook, stirring occasionally, for 5 more minutes. Season
            with salt and pepper, then remove to a plate to cool.</li>
        <li>Make potato filling: Melt butter in the same skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir onion in hot butter
            until translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in mashed potatoes, salt, and white pepper. Remove from heat. </li>
        <li>Make dough: Beat together sour cream and eggs in a large bowl until smooth. Sift flour, baking powder, and
            salt into a separate bowl; stir into sour cream mixture until dough comes together. </li>
        <li>Knead dough on a lightly floured surface until firm and smooth. </li>
        <li>Divide dough in half, then roll out one half to 1/8-inch thickness. Cut into 3-inch rounds using a biscuit
            cutter. Place a small spoonful of potato filling into the center of each round. </li>
        <li>Moisten edges with water, fold over, and press with a fork to seal. Roll and fill remaining dough half with
            sauerkraut filling. </li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pierogies in batches to boiling water and cook
            until they float to the top, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon. </li>
        <li>Enjoy! </li>
